     <h2>Benefits of international markets</h2>
     
     <ol>
  
  <li>More Customers: International trade can allow companies to sell their products to more people, which means they can earn more money. For example, if a company sells its product in one country, it may be able to sell it in other countries too. As a result, the company will have more customers and make more money than if it only sold in one country.</li>
   <br>
    
    <li>More Sales: If your product is sold internationally, then more people will be able to buy it. This means more revenue for your company and more products sold overall. It also means that there's an opportunity for you to expand into other markets and become even more profitable than before.</li>
    
    <br>
    
    <li>Longer Product Lifespan: 
Global trade expands the market for products and services, which can lead to longer product lifespans. If a country doesn't have enough export demand, it can trade with other countries to get more customers for its goods and services. This means that products don't need to be replaced as often since they will have more buyers who will purchase them over time. 
</li>

  <h2>Risk of  International Markets</h2>
 <ol>
 <li>Take payment in full (or a decent percentage of money upfront): Taking 100 percent of the amount owed, or a fair percentage, before rendering the services at the time of the placement of an order can be used to cut down administrative expenses and finance charges. This eliminates the risk of non-payment. Although this may be difficult for new businesses and exporters, it can be worked out with little negotiation.</li>
 <br>
 <li>Country and Political Risks: These are risks such as non-tariff trade barriers, central bank exchange regulations, or ban on the sale of certain products in specific countries. For instance, several countries have banned products obtained from threatened animal species. There would be certain things that would never be under your control, such as sanctions, and you must be prepared to overcome them. You can find more information on such restrictions by checking the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the specific country.</li>
<br>
<li>Exchange Control Regulations: Several developing nations operate certain exchange control regulations associated with money flow from and to their country. You need to identify if these regulations are effective in the country where you intend to trade. This is because these can delay your payments.</li>

<h2>Pros and cons of tariffs</h2>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Advantages</th>
<th>Disadvantages</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Protection of Domestic Industries: Tariffs serve as a vital shield for emerging and established domestic industries against foreign competition. By increasing the price of imported goods, local businesses gain breathing room to develop their capabilities and market presence.</td>

<td>Higher Consumer Prices and Reduced Purchasing Power: Tariffs directly impact consumers by increasing the prices of imported goods. When governments impose these trade barriers, businesses typically pass the additional costs to end consumers. For example, if a 25% tariff is placed on imported electronics, consumers might see a £500 smartphone increase to £625. This price inflation affects not just luxury items but also essential goods, reducing households’ real purchasing power.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>National Security Enhancement: Tariffs can play a crucial role in maintaining national security by ensuring domestic production capacity in strategic industries. Critical sectors such as steel, aluminum, advanced technology, and agricultural products often receive tariff protection to maintain domestic production capabilities.</td>

<td>Reduced Market Competition and Innovation: When tariffs shield domestic industries from international competition, they often lead to market inefficiencies and reduced innovation. Protected companies face less pressure to improve their products, optimise operations, and/or reduce costs. </td>
</tr>

<p><b>Tariffs definition:</b>
Tariffs are taxes or duties imposed by governments on imported goods. They increase the cost of foreign products, protecting domestic industries and raising revenue. Tariffs can influence international trade, affect consumer prices, and sometimes lead to trade disputes between countries.</p>
